Gina was on benzedrine
The wall was gone
Build it up
Bobby was nowhere
The dream was over
The pain was not
Let the dream be the dream without the pain
While the wall is as low as Gina
Put Bobby with the dream into a bottle
Let Bobby be the dream 
Let the dream be a bottle
Whisper the dream 
Build the wall up
